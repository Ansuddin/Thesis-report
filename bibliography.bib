@article{owasp,
abstract = {Insecure software is undermining our financial, healthcare, defense, energy, and other critical infrastructure. As our softwa re becomes increasingly complex, and connected, the difficulty of achieving application security increases exponentially. The rapid pace of modern software development processes makes the most common risks essential to discover and resolve quickly and accurately. We can no longer afford to tolerate relatively simple security problems like those presented in this OWASP Top 10.},

@article{Sabelfeld2003,
abstract = {Current standard security practices do not provide substantial assurance that the end-to-end behavior of a computing system satisfies important security policies such as confidentiality. An end-to-end confidentiality policy might assert that secret input data cannot be inferred by an attacker through the attacker's observations of system output; this policy regulates information flow. Conventional security mechanisms such as access control and encryption do not directly address the enforcement of information-flow policies. Previously, a promising new approach has been developed: the use of programming-language techniques for specifying and enforcing information-flow policies. In this paper, we survey the past three decades of research on information-flow security, particularly focusing on work that uses static program analysis to enforce information-flow policies. We give a structured view of work in the area and identify some important open challenges.},

@book{TheGovernment2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. All rights are reserved. Tropical dry climates are home to unique forest ecosystems, many of which are affected by strong phenological patterns. In the Americas, tropical dry forest ecosystems account for 40 {\%} of their original extension, and are highly affected by deforestation patterns given the fact that they are located on high fertile forests. Moreover, forest presented in these ecosystems can be considered natural barometers to understand the impact of climate change. In this chapter we first presented an overview of the ecological characteristics of forests present in tropical dry climates. We explore also linkages between environmental change, conservation biology and land-use/cover change (including the role of remote sensing) in tropical dry environments. We conclude this chapter with an overview of future research avenues to improve our knowledge of the ecological mechanisms associated to forests in tropical dry climates.},

@article{Signal,
abstract = {Signal is a new security protocol that provides end-to-end encryption for instant messaging. It has recently been adopted by WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Google Allo among many others; the first two of these have at least 1 billion active users. Signal includes several uncommon security properties (such as " future secrecy " or " post-compromise security "), enabled by a novel technique called ratcheting in which session keys are updated with every message sent. Despite its importance and novelty, there has been little to no academic analysis of the Signal protocol. We conduct the first security analysis of Signal's Key Agreement and Double Ratchet as a multi-stage key exchange protocol. We extract from the implementation a formal description of the abstract protocol, define a security model which can capture the " ratcheting " key update structure, and prove the security of Signal's core in our model. Our presentation and results can serve as a starting point for other analyses of this widely adopted protocol.},
