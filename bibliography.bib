As our softwa re becomes increasingly complex, and connected, the difficulty of achieving application security increases exponentially. The rapid pace of modern software development processes makes the most common risks essential to discover and resolve quickly and accurately. We can no longer afford to tolerate relatively simple security problems like those presented in this OWASP Top 10.},

@article{Sabelfeld2003,
abstract = {Current standard security practices do not provide substantial assurance that the end-to-end behavior of a computing system satisfies important security policies such as confidentiality. An end-to-end confidentiality policy might assert that secret input data cannot be inferred by an attacker through the attacker's observations of system output; this policy regulates information flow. Conventional security mechanisms such as access control and encryption do not directly address the enforcement of information-flow policies. Previously, a promising new approach has been developed: the use of programming-language techniques for specifying and enforcing information-flow policies. In this paper, we survey the past three decades of research on information-flow security, particularly focusing on work that uses static program analysis to enforce information-flow policies. We give a structured view of work in the area and identify some important open challenges.},

Tropical dry climates are home to unique forest ecosystems, many of which are affected by strong phenological patterns. In the Americas, tropical dry forest ecosystems account for 40 {\%} of their original extension, and are highly affected by deforestation patterns given the fact that they are located on high fertile forests. Moreover, forest presented in these ecosystems can be considered natural barometers to understand the impact of climate change. In this chapter we first presented an overview of the ecological characteristics of forests present in tropical dry climates. We explore also linkages between environmental change, conservation biology and land-use/cover change (including the role of remote sensing) in tropical dry environments. We conclude this chapter with an overview of future research avenues to improve our knowledge of the ecological mechanisms associated to forests in tropical dry climates.},

@article{Signal,
abstract = {Signal is a new security protocol that provides end-to-end encryption for instant messaging. It has recently been adopted by WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Google Allo among many others; the first two of these have at least 1 billion active users. Signal includes several uncommon security properties (such as " future secrecy " or " post-compromise security "), enabled by a novel technique called ratcheting in which session keys are updated with every message sent. Despite its importance and novelty, there has been little to no academic analysis of the Signal protocol. We conduct the first security analysis of Signal's Key Agreement and Double Ratchet as a multi-stage key exchange protocol. We extract from the implementation a formal description of the abstract protocol, define a security model which can capture the " ratcheting " key update structure, and prove the security of Signal's core in our model. Our presentation and results can serve as a starting point for other analyses of this widely adopted protocol.},

@article{ncc,
abstract = {In September 2016, Matrix, along with financial support from the Open Technology Fund, engaged NCC Group's Cryptography Services Practice to perform a targeted review of their cryptographic library Olm. The review covered two major components of the Olm library: the double ratchet used for peer-to-peer communications, and Megolm, the group ratcheting mechanism. Matrix has produced several reference implementations that make use of the Olm library including the client-server SDK for JavaScript, matrix- js-sdk. Matrix-js-sdk was not reviewed during the engagement; however, certain remediations to issues were applied to this implementation and not Olm. The review covered the 1.3.0 release of the Olm library. Two consultants performed the engagement over a span of two weeks (September 19 to September 30, 2016) and consisted of 15 person-days of effort. A follow-up review of fixes was performed over the latter half of October.},

@techreport{textsecure,
abstract = {Instant Messaging has attracted a lot of attention by users for both private and business communication and has especially gained popularity as low-cost short message replacement on mobile devices. However, most popular mobile messaging apps do not provide end-to-end security. Press releases about mass surveillance performed by intelligence services such as NSA and GCHQ lead many people looking for means that allow them to preserve the security and privacy of their communication on the Internet. Additionally fueled by Facebook's acquisition of the hugely popular messaging app WHATSAPP, alternatives that claim to provide secure communication experienced a significant increase of new users. A messaging app that has attracted a lot of attention lately is TEXTSECURE, an app that claims to provide secure instant messaging and has a large number of installations via Google's Play Store. It's protocol is part of Android's most popular aftermarket firmware CYANOGENMOD. In this paper, we present the first complete description of TEXTSECURE's complex cryptographic protocol and are the first to provide a thorough security analysis of TEXTSECURE. Among other findings, we present an Unknown Key-Share Attack on the protocol, along with a mitigation strategy, which has been acknowledged by TEXTSECURE's developers. Furthermore, we formally prove that-if our mitigation is applied-TEXTSECURE's push messaging can indeed achieve the goals of authenticity and confidentiality.},

@article{Askarov2008,
abstract = {Current tools for analysing information flow in$\backslash$nprograms build upon ideas going back to Denning's$\backslash$nwork from the 70's. These systems enforce an$\backslash$nimperfect notion of information flow which has$\backslash$nbecome known as termination-insensitive$\backslash$nnoninterference. Under this version of$\backslash$nnoninterference, information leaks are permitted if$\backslash$nthey are transmitted purely by the program's$\backslash$ntermination behaviour (i.e., whether it terminates$\backslash$nor not). This imperfection is the price to pay for$\backslash$nhaving a security condition which is relatively$\backslash$nliberal (e.g. allowing while-loops whose termination$\backslash$nmay depend on the value of a secret) and easy to$\backslash$ncheck. But what is the price exactly? We argue that,$\backslash$nin the presence of output, the price is higher than$\backslash$nthe "one bit" often claimed informally in the$\backslash$nliterature, and effectively such programs can leak$\backslash$nall of their secrets. In this paper we develop a$\backslash$ndefinition of termination-insensitive$\backslash$nnoninterference suitable for reasoning about$\backslash$nprograms with outputs. We show that the definition$\backslash$ngeneralises "batch-job" style definitions from the$\backslash$nliterature and that it is indeed satisfied by a$\backslash$nDenning-style program analysis with output. Although$\backslash$nmore than a bit of information can be leaked by$\backslash$nprograms satisfying this condition, we show that the$\backslash$nbest an attacker can do is a brute-force attack,$\backslash$nwhich means that the attacker cannot reliably (in a$\backslash$ntechnical sense) learn the secret in polynomial time$\backslash$nin the size of the secret. If we further assume that$\backslash$nsecrets are uniformly distributed, we show that the$\backslash$nadvantage the attacker gains when guessing the$\backslash$nsecret after observing a polynomial amount of output$\backslash$nis negligible in the size of the secret.},

abstract = {Current standard security practices do not provide substantial assurance that the end-to-end behavior of a computing system satisfies important security policies such as confidentiality. An end-to-end confidentiality policy might assert that secret input data cannot be inferred by an attacker through the attacker's observations of system output; this policy regulates information flow. Conventional security mechanisms such as access control and encryption do not directly address the enforcement of information-flow policies. Previously, a promising new approach has been developed: the use of programming-language techniques for specifying and enforcing information-flow policies. In this paper, we survey the past three decades of research on information-flow security, particularly focusing on work that uses static program analysis to enforce information-flow policies. We give a structured view of work in the area and identify some important open challenges.},

@article{Sabelfeld2009,
abstract = {Computing systems often deliberately release (or declassify) sensitive information. A principal security concern for systems permitting information release is whether this release is safe: is it possible that the attacker compromises the information release mechanism and extracts more secret information than intended? While the security community has recognised the importance of the problem, the state-of-the-art in information release is, unfortunately, a number of approaches with somewhat unconnected semantic goals. We provide a road map of the main directions of current research, by classifying the basic goals according to what information is released, who releases information, where in the system information is released, and when information can be released. With a general declassification framework as a long-term goal, we identify some prudent principles of declassification. These principles shed light on existing definitions and may also serve as useful "sanity checks" for emerging models.},

@article{Sabelfeld2010,
abstract = {Historically, dynamic techniques are the pioneers of the area of information flow in the 70's. In their seminal work, Denning and Denning suggest a static alternative for information-flow analysis. Following this work, the 90's see the domination of static techniques for information flow. The common wisdom appears to be that dynamic approaches are not a good match for security since monitoring a single path misses public side effects that could have happened in other paths. Dynamic techniques for information flow are on the rise again, driven by the need for permissiveness in today's dynamic applications. But they still involve nontrivial static checks for leaks related to control flow. This paper demonstrates that it is possible for a purely dynamic enforcement to be as secure as Denning-style static information-flow analysis, despite the common wisdom. We do have the trade-off that static techniques have benefits of reducing runtime overhead, and dynamic techniques have the benefits of permissiveness (this, for example, is of particular importance in dynamic applications, where freshly generated code is evaluated). But on the security side, we show for a simple imperative language that both Denning-style analysis and dynamic enforcement have the same assurance: termination-insensitive noninterference.},

@article{Hedin2014,
abstract = {JavaScript drives the evolution of the web into a powerful application$\backslash$nplatform. Increasingly, web applications combine services from different$\backslash$nproviders. The script inclusion mechanism routinely turns barebone web$\backslash$npages into fully-fledged services built up from third-party code. Such$\backslash$ncode provides a range of facilities from helper utilities (such as jQuery)$\backslash$nto readily available services (such as Google Analytics and Tynt). This$\backslash$nposes a security challenge of ensuring that the integrated third-party code$\backslash$nrespects security and privacy.$\backslash$nThis paper presents$\backslash$nJSFlow$\backslash$n, a security-enhanced JavaScript interpreter$\backslash$nfor fine-grained tracking of information flow. We show how to resolve$\backslash$npractical challenges for enforcing information-flow policies for the full$\backslash$nJavaScript language, as well as the challenges of tracking information in$\backslash$nthe presence of libraries, as provided by browser APIs.$\backslash$nThe interpreter is itself written in JavaScript, which enables deploy-$\backslash$nment as a Firefox extension. Using this extension we have performed$\backslash$npractical studies to provide in-depth understanding of information manip-$\backslash$nulation by third-party scripts such as Google Analytics. The experiments$\backslash$nshow that different sites intended to provide similar services effectuate$\backslash$nrather different security policies for the user's sensitive information: some$\backslash$nensure it does not leave the browser, others share it with the originating$\backslash$nserver, while yet others freely propagate it to third parties.},
