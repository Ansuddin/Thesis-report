abstract = {Insecure software is undermining our financial, healthcare, defense, energy, and other critical infrastructure. As our softwa re becomes increasingly complex, and connected, the difficulty of achieving application security increases exponentially. The rapid pace of modern software development processes makes the most common risks essential to discover and resolve quickly and accurately. We can no longer afford to tolerate relatively simple security problems like those presented in this OWASP Top 10.},

@article{Sabelfeld2003,
abstract = {Current standard security practices do not provide substantial assurance that the end-to-end behavior of a computing system satisfies important security policies such as confidentiality. An end-to-end confidentiality policy might assert that secret input data cannot be inferred by an attacker through the attacker's observations of system output; this policy regulates information flow. Conventional security mechanisms such as access control and encryption do not directly address the enforcement of information-flow policies. Previously, a promising new approach has been developed: the use of programming-language techniques for specifying and enforcing information-flow policies. In this paper, we survey the past three decades of research on information-flow security, particularly focusing on work that uses static program analysis to enforce information-flow policies. We give a structured view of work in the area and identify some important open challenges.},

@book{TheGovernment2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. All rights are reserved. Tropical dry climates are home to unique forest ecosystems, many of which are affected by strong phenological patterns. In the Americas, tropical dry forest ecosystems account for 40 {\%} of their original extension, and are highly affected by deforestation patterns given the fact that they are located on high fertile forests. Moreover, forest presented in these ecosystems can be considered natural barometers to understand the impact of climate change. In this chapter we first presented an overview of the ecological characteristics of forests present in tropical dry climates. We explore also linkages between environmental change, conservation biology and land-use/cover change (including the role of remote sensing) in tropical dry environments. We conclude this chapter with an overview of future research avenues to improve our knowledge of the ecological mechanisms associated to forests in tropical dry climates.},

@article{Signal,
abstract = {Signal is a new security protocol that provides end-to-end encryption for instant messaging. It has recently been adopted by WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Google Allo among many others; the first two of these have at least 1 billion active users. Signal includes several uncommon security properties (such as " future secrecy " or " post-compromise security "), enabled by a novel technique called ratcheting in which session keys are updated with every message sent. Despite its importance and novelty, there has been little to no academic analysis of the Signal protocol. We conduct the first security analysis of Signal's Key Agreement and Double Ratchet as a multi-stage key exchange protocol. We extract from the implementation a formal description of the abstract protocol, define a security model which can capture the " ratcheting " key update structure, and prove the security of Signal's core in our model. Our presentation and results can serve as a starting point for other analyses of this widely adopted protocol.},

@article{ncc,
abstract = {In September 2016, Matrix, along with financial support from the Open Technology Fund, engaged NCC Group's Cryptography Services Practice to perform a targeted review of their cryptographic library Olm. The review covered two major components of the Olm library: the double ratchet used for peer-to-peer communications, and Megolm, the group ratcheting mechanism. Matrix has produced several reference implementations that make use of the Olm library including the client-server SDK for JavaScript, matrix- js-sdk. Matrix-js-sdk was not reviewed during the engagement; however, certain remediations to issues were applied to this implementation and not Olm. The review covered the 1.3.0 release of the Olm library. Two consultants performed the engagement over a span of two weeks (September 19 to September 30, 2016) and consisted of 15 person-days of effort. A follow-up review of fixes was performed over the latter half of October.},

@techreport{textsecure,
abstract = {Instant Messaging has attracted a lot of attention by users for both private and business communication and has especially gained popularity as low-cost short message replacement on mobile devices. However, most popular mobile messaging apps do not provide end-to-end security. Press releases about mass surveillance performed by intelligence services such as NSA and GCHQ lead many people looking for means that allow them to preserve the security and privacy of their communication on the Internet. Additionally fueled by Facebook's acquisition of the hugely popular messaging app WHATSAPP, alternatives that claim to provide secure communication experienced a significant increase of new users. A messaging app that has attracted a lot of attention lately is TEXTSECURE, an app that claims to provide secure instant messaging and has a large number of installations via Google's Play Store. It's protocol is part of Android's most popular aftermarket firmware CYANOGENMOD. In this paper, we present the first complete description of TEXTSECURE's complex cryptographic protocol and are the first to provide a thorough security analysis of TEXTSECURE. Among other findings, we present an Unknown Key-Share Attack on the protocol, along with a mitigation strategy, which has been acknowledged by TEXTSECURE's developers. Furthermore, we formally prove that-if our mitigation is applied-TEXTSECURE's push messaging can indeed achieve the goals of authenticity and confidentiality.},
