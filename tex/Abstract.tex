The thesis is a case study of secure implementation using the Information-Flow Control tool Paragon on top of the Matrix protocol. The implementation is a prototype inspired by Danish patient journals systems which requires end-to-end security. End-to-end security is the guarantee of confidentiality and integrity throughout the system. Matrix is a secure communication protocol that ensures confidentiality and integrity of information through end-to-end encryption. However encryption provides no such guarantees once the information is decrypted at the endpoints. Information-Flow Control is such a mechanism that can ensure confidentiality and integrity at the endpoints by enforcing security policies. Paragon is a Java based programming language with the ability to define and enforce security policies.

The thesis contributes with a interface between Paragon and Matrix allowing implementations with end-to-end security on top of Matrix.
