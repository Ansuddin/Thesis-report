\section{Survey of IFC Tools}

\subsection{JIF}

\subsection{Fabric}

\subsection{Paragon}

\subsection{JSFlow}
Not possible to use Matrix library with JSFlow because of missing support for libaries such as require (in node). Also overhead with configuring JSFlow to be the interpretor.

Swift, SIF, FlowR, JFlow, LIO


\subsection{Selection of IFC tool}
The selection of IFC tool put emphasis on the practical usage in combination with Matrix. 

\section{Evaluation of Matrix security model}



% Tools issue: java sdk for matrix is beta and not fully implemented. 
% Best supported sdk is for javascript or python. Problem of running javascript code or python code with Paragon (java)
% Maybe better to use JSFlow instead
