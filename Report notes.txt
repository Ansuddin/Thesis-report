Analysis/Discussion: Each actor must be a final initialized instance. Each actor is initialized globally and then defined in a policy. What if we have hundreds of actors in a Hospital would each actor have to be initialized and defined? 
Is it possible to define policies based on type?

The above might be false!



Implementation:
    Limitation of Matrix SDK
        JS is the main SDK.
        Java SDK does not support e2e
        Python does support defining custom types.

Discussion:
    Other use cases for information flow control for matrix:
    Implementing SDK in IFC tool 
    Protection of ratchet keys with IFC.
